# Winter Products Purchase

This is my second Mod 2 Project for Per Scholas. The purpose of this project was to create an online store utilizing MongoBD database and incorporate CRUD (create, read, update and delete) and it functions. I was inspired by my home state Colorado, to create winter accessories that will keep you warm during the cold snowy days.
